# Solana Workspace

Hello, my name is Gil and I'm learning Solana Development.

This repository contains my learning journey, from the basics to more complex topics.

## Projects

- [GotCritter](jogo-do-bicho), or "jogo-do-bicho", is a complete betting game built on Solana. It's a complex project but it's fully documented.
- [Movie Review](movie-review-v2) is a program to learn how to use SPL Token and PDA to create a review system for movies.
- [Anchor Counter](anchor-counter2) is a simple program to learn the basics of Anchor.
- [Solana Send Frontend](solana-send-frontend) is a simple frontend to learn how to send SOL to an address.
- [Solana Node Labs](solana-node-labs) is a collection of scripts to learn how to use the SDK on NodeJS.

I will continue to update this repository with new projects and improvements.
